# Node.JS task 5 - Card Guessing Game

- I've created a card guessing game using Node.JS
- I've used EJS which is  a templating engine for Node.JS to generate HTML markup with plain  JavaScript.
- I've used Express.js which is a lightweight and flexible web application framework for Node.js. 
- I've created a simple user-friendly interface
- I've used CSS to style the game
- I've used JavaScript to add interactivity to the game
- I've included a total of 36 cards in the deck, 6 rows and 6 columns
- When all cards are matched , the game ends and a message is displayed
- Users are able to restart/ reset the game by clicking on the reset/ restart button
